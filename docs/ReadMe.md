# BlingRunner

## Background



[BlingRunner](https://github.com/ravisraval/BlingRunner) is a javascript browser game. It utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.

## Key Features, MVP
***
#### Infinitely Scrolling Board
  The game features a board that will continually scroll until a round is over. The round will end when a user successfully completes the round or misses too many blings, therefore losing.
  Blings are randomly generated parts of the board. The user must direct the car over these blings. When successful, the game will produce a corresponding sound. When unsuccessful, the game will play an error sound.
